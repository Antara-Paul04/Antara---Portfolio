            <div class="about-text">Hey there! I'm Antara, and I've been hooked on coding and tech since I was ten. It's been an incredible journey of exploration and fascination that's led me to dive into languages like C, Python, Java, HTML, CSS, JS and more. Lately, I've been getting a kick out of Dart and Flutterâ€”though I'm still not sure if that officially makes me an app developer?
                What is funny is until recently, I never thought I had a knack for design. Turns out, I was dead wrong! Now, as the Creative Lead at GDSC IIITK, I'm knee-deep in design projects, loving every minute of it, and learning tons along the way.
                Thanks to volunteering at and attending tech conferences, my social anxiety gradually diminished. I've realized that learning should be fun and exciting, not a snooze fest. And hey, speaking of fun, did you know I'm also a pro at Indian classical singing? Yep, been at it for a cool decade now.</div>
